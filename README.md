# Minigolf physics

I wanted to see if I could create basic physics suited for a minigolf game using the [detec-collisions](https://www.npmjs.com/package/detect-collisions) package.

So far it's going well. I still have to add user control over the ball. For now it gets launched in a random direction as a test.
