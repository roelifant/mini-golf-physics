# Minigolf physics

I wanted to see if I could create basic physics suited for a minigolf game using the [detect-collisions](https://www.npmjs.com/package/detect-collisions) package.

I'm using it to remake an old Unity game I made long ago, documented [here](https://roelifant.com/projects/golf-duel/doc.php).
